# 📑 PROJECT DOCUMENTATION: URBAN COURIER

**Developer Name:** Qasim Kazmi  
**Student Number:** 240008056  
**Course:** DGD0011-1 - Homework 1  
**Project Status:** Final Submission Ready  
**Architecture:** Decoupled Scriptable Object Pattern  
**Core Mechanic:** Root Motion & Procedural Target Matching

## 1. Executive Summary & GDD

### 1.1 The Concept
**Urban Courier** is a high-fidelity 3D third-person parkour prototype. The project focuses on creating a professional-grade controller where animations drive the physics (Root Motion), rather than code forcing the character to slide. The player navigates an urban obstacle course to intercept "Data Tokens."

### 1.2 The Core Loop
* **Locomotion:** Navigating the environment using an animation-driven Blend Tree.
* **Obstacle Detection:** Dynamically scanning geometry via 2-step raycasting.
* **Vault Execution:** Using Target Matching to align the character’s hand to physical ledges.
* **Data Interception:** Collecting tokens to update a decoupled UI via Scriptable Object Game Events.

---

## 2. Character Control & Animation

### 2.1 Root Motion Implementation
Unlike standard controllers that move a "capsule" independently of the animation, this project uses a full Root Motion configuration to ensure zero "foot sliding."
* **Physics Sync:** The `ThirdPersonController.cs` script utilizes the `ReceiveRootMotion(Vector3 animationDeltaPosition)` callback.
* **The Logic:** Unity’s Animator calculates the precise distance the feet moved in the animation. This delta is passed to the `CharacterController.Move()` function, keeping the physical capsule perfectly synced with the 3D mesh.

### 2.2 Animator Architecture
* **Locomotion Blend Tree:** A **2D Simple Directional Blend Tree** handles smooth transitions between Idle, Walk, and Sprint based on `InputX` and `InputY` parameters.
* **Code-Driven Transitions:** To avoid "Spaghetti" Animator controllers, the system uses `animator.CrossFadeInFixedTime("Vault", 0.15f)`. This allows the script to trigger the vault state instantly with a smooth blend, bypassing manual transition lines.

### 2.3 Procedural Vaulting & Target Matching
The vaulting system is procedural and height-aware rather than a static animation.
* **Dual-Step Raycast Detection:**
    1.  **Forward Ray:** Scans for obstacles within a `1.2m` range.
    2.  **Downward Ray:** Shoots from `vaultMaxHeight` down to find the exact Y-coordinate of the ledge.
* **Target Matching:** Using `animator.MatchTarget()`, the system mathematically "stretches" the Vault animation so the character’s **Right Hand** snaps perfectly to the ledge's edge, regardless of the obstacle's specific height.

---

## 3. Scriptable Object Architecture
The project strictly follows the **Modular Unity Architecture** to ensure systems are independent (decoupled).

### 3.1 Variables & Flexible References
* **Decoupling:** Player stats (Score) are stored in `FloatVariable` assets in the Project folder.
* **Flexible Reference Struct:** The `FloatReference` allows designers to toggle between a **Constant** value or a **Variable** asset in the Inspector without touching code.

### 3.2 Game Event System (Broadcaster/Listener)
* **The Broadcaster:** When a token is collected, it raises a `GameEvent` Scriptable Object (`Event_ScoreChanged`).
* **The Listener:** The UI `GameEventListener` component hears this signal and triggers the `UpdateScoreText` function.
* **Benefit:** The token script does not know the UI exists, and vice versa. They are 100% independent.

### 3.3 Runtime Sets
* **Dynamic Tracking:** A `CollectibleSet` tracks all active tokens in the level. 
* **Performance:** Objects automatically register/unregister from the set on `OnEnable`/`OnDisable`. This eliminates the need for expensive `FindObjectsOfType` calls.

### 3.4 Advanced Enums
* **Design:** Item types (e.g., `Type_Coin`) are created as `ItemTypeSO` assets. This allows designers to add new item categories directly in the Project folder without writing new C# enums.

---

## 4. UI & Interaction System

### 4.1 TextMeshPro Implementation
* **Rendering:** TextMeshPro (TMP) is used for high-quality, resolution-independent text.
* **Anchor Presets:** UI elements are anchored using **Top-Center** presets to maintain layout consistency across various screen aspect ratios (16:9, 21:9, etc.).
* **Canvas Management:** The UI resides in a **Screen Space - Overlay** Canvas, ensuring it remains projected correctly on the player's screen at all times.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting & Build Stability Fixes
Extensive debugging was performed to resolve "Build-Only" bugs that do not appear in the Unity Editor.

### 5.1 The ProBuilder Shader Crash
* **Issue:** Standalone builds failed because ProBuilder's default "Vertex Color" shader is incompatible with standard compilers.
* **Fix:** All ProBuilder geometry was stripped of default materials and replaced with custom **URP Standard Materials**.

### 5.2 The 1000 FPS Animation Freeze
* **Issue:** At ultra-high framerates in builds, the Animator's `MatchTarget` math desynced, causing character freezing.
* **Fix:** Implemented `Application.targetFrameRate = 60;` in the `Awake()` method to normalize physics and animation timing.

### 5.3 MatchTarget Transition Lock
* **Issue:** Calling `MatchTarget` while the Animator is still "blending" into a state causes a fatal error.
* **Fix:** Wrapped snapping logic in a strict check: `if (stateInfo.IsName("Vault") && !animator.IsInTransition(0))`.
